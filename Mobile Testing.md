Mobile Testing
--------
Most critical factor that we have to consider while doing test planning is checking the **Mobile Application type.** There are mostly three types of mobile applications: Mobile Web, Native App, and Hybrid App. The classification is based on the development efforts and App redistribution strategy.


* Point1 **Mobile Web(Web App)** -Web apps are not real application, they are websites that open in our smartphones with the help of a web browser.

Mobile websites have the largest audience.
 
Example: Tutorials point

Benefits : 
* Point1 **Easy access**
* Point2 **Easy development** : Developing responsive design and restructuring the content to be properly displayed on a smaller screen/hardware will make any desktop website mobile friendly.
* Point3 **Easy update ** Just update in one location and all the users automatically have access to the latest version of the site.
* Point4 No installation required, as compared to native or hybrid app.

Downside :
* Point1 Mobile websites cannot use some of the features. For example, access to the file system and local resources isn’t available in websites.
* Point2 Users won’t have the app’s icon on their home screen as a constant reminder. The website needs to be opened in a web browser only.


**Native App** - A native app is developed specifically for one platform. It can be installed through an application store (such as Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store).

Example − Whatsapp.

Benefits −

* Point1 Native Apps live on the device and are accessed through icons on the device home screen.

* Point2 They can take full advantage of all the device features − they can use the camera, the GPS, the list of contacts, and so on. 

* Point3 Native apps can use the device’s notification system and can work offline.

* Point4 Publishers can make use of push-notifications, alerting users every time a new piece of content is published or when their attention is required.

* Point5 Native Apps maintain UI design of each operating system, thus they offer the best user experience. For example, a Native App can have a left-aligned header in Android and a center-aligned header in iOS.

Downside −

* Point1 High cost for building the app : Native apps developed for one platform will not run on another platform. An App built for Android will not run on iOS. We need to build a different App altogether for iOS. Because of this reason, we need to maintain multiple versions of the App.

* Point2 Even though you might publish native Apps, you’ll want to keep the mobile website well maintained, as mobile brings more traffic. So maintenance is higher.


**Hybrid App**
They can be well described as a mixture of Web App and Native App.

Example - Wikipedia.

Benefits −

* Point1 Developing a Hybrid App is cheaper than developing a Native App. It can be built for cross-platforms, i.e., reduced cost for App development.

* Point2 Maintenance is simple, as there are not many versions to be maintained.

* Point3 It can be found in the App Store, which makes the distribution easy.

* Point4 It has a browser embedded within the app only.

Downside −

* Point1 Graphics are less accustomed with the operating system as compared to Native Apps.

* Point2 Hybrid Apps are slower than Native Apps.
